# Beer Debt Mk.2

For the [Normalizing XPages Development](http://iamiconus.org/iamiconus/iconus2016.nsf/session.xsp?action=openDocument&documentId=10DC98278072638C86257F77004D2BE7) ICON US 2016 session with [Shean McManus](https://twitter.com/sheanpmcmanus) and [Eric McCormick](https://twitter.com/edm00se).

## To Download and Use This Application

### Required:

* node and npm, install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (required for development tooling)
* Domino Designer for development of server-side assets and local web preview
* (optional) a Domino server for interaction with the Domino Data Services (DDS)
  * to use DDS on the server, it must be [enabled and set up correctly](https://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/ddwiki.nsf/xpAPIViewer.xsp?lookupName=IBM+Domino+Access+Services+9.0.1#action=openDocument&content=catcontent&ct=api)
* using without a Domino server with DDS enabled will still work with local web preview, you will/may notice a failing over of an initial request against the DDS before resolving a data connection via an _xe:resetService_ located within the `api.xsp` XPage

### To Use:

* Clone the repository		`git clone https://github.com/edm00se/beer-debt-mk2.git`
* Install dependencies from npm	`npm install`
  * the post-install script for this will run the necessary `bower install` and initial build with `grunt`
  * subsequent builds can make use of `npm run build` (which means that bower and grunt are not needed to be installed globally)
* Import the On Disk Project (ODP) in Designerâ€™s Package Explorer (or Navigator)
* Right-click the ODP and Associate with New/Existing NSF
* Done!

### Using the Pre-Built NSF
You can use the pre-built NSF from the [latest release](https://github.com/edm00se/beer-debt-mk2/releases/latest). The one potential issue you may run into is the `lwpd.domino.adapter.jar` in your build path may need to be updated, for either path or version. Please consult [the blog post from Sven Hasselbach](http://hasselba.ch/blog/?p=746) on the subject for a more detailed explanation.
